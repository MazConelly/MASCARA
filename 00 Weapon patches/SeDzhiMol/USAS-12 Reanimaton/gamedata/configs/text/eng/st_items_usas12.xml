		<text>The Daewoo Precision Industries USAS-12 (Universal Sports Automatic Shotgun 12 gauge) is an automatic shotgun designed for combat manufactured in South Korea by Daewoo Precision Industries in 1980s. How a Korean gun made it into Ukraine is something stalkers would very much like to know. Maybe there's a K2 rifle out there.\n
