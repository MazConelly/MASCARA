	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a1_descr">
		<text>Steyr AUG A1 in standard Austrian Army rifle configuration (tan colour). The AUG is an Austrian bullpup 5.56mm assault rifle, designed in the 1960s by Steyr Mannlicher GmbH &amp; Co KG (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch). The AUG (Armee-Universal-Gewehr "universal army rifle") was adopted by the Austrian Army as the StG 77 (Sturmgewehr 77) in 1978, where it replaced the 7.62mm StG 58 automatic rifle (a licence-built FN FAL). In production since 1978, it is the standard small arm of the Austrian Bundesheer and various national police units. Gun enthusiasts are fond of this rifle simply for the integrated scope.\n

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a2_descr">
		<text>The AUG A2 is an improvement of the A1, introduced in 1997, one of the key differences is the replacement of the integral scope with a Picatinny rail, allowing all sorts of iron and reflex sights, as well as scopes, to be added. It is a common rifle to find in the black market, and a very reliable one.\n

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a3_descr">
		<text>Steyr AUG A3 is a further improvement of both the A1 and A2, introduced in 2005. It is also the current standard rifle of the Austrian Army, replacing both A1 and A2. Having the same Picatinny Rail integration as the A2 in full-length, as well as coming with an external bolt release located above the magwell, the rifle is easily able to fit any ironsight or reflex sight, including any scope. It is the modern iteration of the AUG, hence the most common rifle, but that doesn't make it a commodity in The Zone.\n

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_thales_descr">
		<text>The Thales F90, also known as the EF88, is an improvement of the Australian version of the AUG, the F88 Austeyr. Produced in 2012 and meant to replace the F88, this is the most modern AUG one can find, having a lot of improvements based on the performance of the F88 itself, which increases its ergonomics and reliability. The unique barrel gives it much better recoil control and accuracy, while the custom foregrip allows for better handling. An incredibly rare gun, brought in by some ex-Australian Spec Ops, for that the price is right.\n

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_9mm_descr">
		<text>Also known as the Steyr AUG Para, although that would be for the original variant that had no Picatinny rails, a different barrel as well as integrated scope &amp;d foregrip. The AUG 9mm is, simply, a sub-machinegun variant chambered in 9x19 Parabellum of the AUG, produced since 1988. It comes with a different unique barrel, bolt and magazine, although a TMP magazine can fit with it. This weapon was made for, as the name would tell, Paratroopers. Kits exist to turn any AUG A3 into the AUG 9mm and viceversa. It is a reliable sub-machinegun, in bullpup format, which is why it's popular amongst Freedomers.\n
