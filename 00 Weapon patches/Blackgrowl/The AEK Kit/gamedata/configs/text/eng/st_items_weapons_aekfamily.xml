		<text>The AEK-972 is a 5.56x45mm version of the AEK-971. It is compatible with the various magazines of the AK-100 rifle family such as the AK-101, AK-102 carbine and AK-108. Its purpose of being an export for Western Countries came short in The Zone, for some expensive black markets were able to acquire this variant and sell it around.\n \n

		<text>The A-545 is a successor of the AEK-971 that saw limited service in the Russian Army, making it very rare even in The Zone. Other than its subtle improvements, which includes a more compact yet ergonomic sliding stock, a rotatory rear drum aperture sight and a two-round burst instead of three, the most obvious would be the lack of a dovetail mount in favour of a Picatinny rail, allowing it to use NATO scopes. \n \n

		<text>Based on previous AK rifles in internal design and layout, the AEK-971 is also equipped with a recoil-balancing mechanism, resulting in more controllable automatic fire. Small batches of this rifle were manufactured for the Russian MVD. This model specifically has a light-beige colour with red stains, symbolizing the Duty faction. Some mechanisms were reassembled or replaced with more reliable ones. Parts are fitted tighter which results in higher muzzle speed.\n \n
