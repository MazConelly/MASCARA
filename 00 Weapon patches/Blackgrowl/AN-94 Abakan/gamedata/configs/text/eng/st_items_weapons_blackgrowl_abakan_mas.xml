		<text>A key improvement of the AN-94 over the AK-74 is the introduction of the additional 2-rounds burst mode. Nikonov design delays the force of recoil until the fired rounds have left the barrel, which along with a unique 1800 rpm two-shot burst function increases body armour piercing capabilities of this firearm. Used by Spetsnaz operators as well as Duty members to take out armoured targets at relatively long ranges.\n \n
