		<text>A short barreled variant of the KS-12, itself a variant of the Saiga-12 semiautomatic shotgun, produced by Kalashnikov USA to work around the US ban on Russian guns. The weapon has a Picatinny rail for use with various types of sights, and includes a higher capacity magazine.\n
		Curiously brought by Duty to provide their elite squads with access to modern sight systems as well as a more ergonomical shotgun platform. Preference or convenience, the faction usually employs closer sources of weaponry; one would assume the Komrad satisfies their standards despite the need to be shipped from the other side of the planet.\n
